	abstract = {This paper deals with active time-harmonic infrared thermography applied to the detection of defects inside thin plates. We propose a method to post-process raw thermograms based on the computation of topological derivatives which will produce much sharper images (namely, where contrast is highly enhanced) than the original thermograms. The reconstruction algorithm does not need information about the number of defects, nor the size or position. A collection of numerical experiments illustrates that the algorithm is highly robust against measurement errors in the thermograms, giving a good approximation of the shape, position and number of defects without the need of an iterative process.},

The electromagnetic inverse scattering problem is recast as a constrained optimization problem, in which we seek to minimize the error when comparing experimental microwave measurements with computer-generated synthetic data for arbitrary targets by approximating a Maxwell forward model. The true targets are then characterized by combining the topological derivatives or energies of such shape functionals for all available receivers and emitters at different frequencies. Our approximations are comparable to the best approximations already obtained by other methods. However, these topological fields admit easy to evaluate closed-form expressions, which speeds up the process.},

The method builds on ideas from classical regularisation theory and recent advances in deep learning to perform learning while making use of prior information about the inverse problem encoded in the forward operator, noise model and a regularising functional. The method results in a gradient-like iterative scheme, where the ‘gradient’ component is learned using a convolutional network that includes the gradients of the data discrepancy and regulariser as input in each iteration. We present results of such a partially learned gradient scheme on a nonlinear tomographic inversion problem with simulated data from both the Sheep-Logan phantom as well as a head CT. The outcome is compared against filtered backprojection and total variation reconstruction and the proposed method provides a 5.4 dB PSNR improvement over the total variation reconstruction while being significantly faster, giving reconstructions of 512 × 512 pixel images in about 0.4 s using a single graphics processing unit (GPU).},

Moreover, by taking into account the spectral properties of the scattered fields, it can be helpful to reduce the effect of noise on data. Accordingly, a 3D inversion strategy in which one performs a preliminary estimation of the support of the targets is considered in this paper to process the experimental data provided by the Institut Fresnel of Marseille, France. In particular, the imaging problem is tackled in a step-wise fashion, in which one first pursues a morphologic characterization of the targets using a linear sampling method based procedure. Then, the retrieved support is exploited to ‘filter’ the data and, finally, in the quantitative characterization of the targets. This last step is performed by using the optimized contrast source extended Born inversion method wherein the estimated support is exploited in order to reduce both the investigated domain and the nonlinearity of the inverse problem.},

Moreover, their performances are often unsatisfactory for aspect-limited measurement configurations and lossy media. In order to tackle these drawbacks, usually faced in subsurface imaging, we propose a simplified and improved formulation based on the physical interpretation of SM. In particular, such a formulation relies on a small number of single polarization probes and exploits multifrequency data, for the first time in the framework of SM. The performances of the resulting approach are verified by monitoring 3-D regions of large extent.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the possibility of multi-frequency reconstruction of sound-soft and penetrable obstacles via the linear sampling method involving either far-ﬁeld or near-ﬁeld observations of the scattered ﬁeld. On establishing a suitable approximate solution to the linear sampling equation and making an assumption of continuous frequency sweep, two possible choices for a cumulative multi-frequency indicator function of the scatterer’s support are proposed. The ﬁrst alternative, termed the ‘serial’ indicator, is taken as a natural extension of its monochromatic companion in the sense that its computation entails space-frequency (as opposed to space) L2-norm of a solution to the linear sampling equation. Under a set of assumptions that include experimental observations down to zero frequency and compact frequency support of the wavelet used to illuminate the obstacle, this indicator function is further related to its time-domain counterpart. As a second possibility, the so-called parallel indicator is alternatively proposed as an L2-norm, in the frequency domain, of the monochromatic indicator function. On the basis of a perturbation analysis which demonstrates that the monochromatic solution of the linear sampling equation behaves as O({\textbar}k2 − k∗2{\textbar}−m), m 1 in the neighborhood of an isolated eigenvalue, k∗2, of the associated interior (Dirichlet or transmission) problem, it is found that the ‘serial’ indicator is unable to distinguish the interior from the exterior of a scatterer in situations when the prescribed frequency band traverses at least one such eigenvalue. In contrast the ‘parallel’ indicator is, due to its particular structure, shown to be insensitive to the presence of pertinent interior eigenvalues (unknown beforehand and typically belonging to a countable set), and thus to be robust in a generic scattering conﬁguration. A set of numerical results, including both ‘ﬁne’ and ‘coarse’ frequency sampling, is included to illustrate the performance of the competing (multi-frequency) indicator functions, demonstrating behavior that is consistent with the theoretical results.},

A constraint is placed on the LSM solution that enforces a phase relationship across frequency that is determined by the electrical path length between the array transmitters and the imaging scene pixels. The effect of the constraint is that image artifacts that do not evince the expected phase relationship according to their position relative to the array are suppressed. We apply the proposed technique to simulated and experimental sparse-aperture data sets and show that the resulting imagery is significantly more faithful to the true target shape as compared to the imagery created with the standard LSM.},

While very successful in many cases, progress has lagged when only limited-aperture measurement is available. In this paper, we perform some elementary study to recover data that can not be measured directly. In particular, we aim at recovering the full-aperture far field data from limited-aperture measurement. Due to the reciprocity relation, the multi-static response matrix (MSR) has a symmetric structure. Using the Green's formula and single layer potential, we propose two schemes to recover full-aperture MSR. The recovered data is tested by a recently proposed direct sampling method and the factorization method. Numerical results show that it is possible to, at least, partially recover the missing data and consequently improve the reconstruction of the scatterer.},

As one of the major sources of error in the data collection process is a result of the strongly coupling 24 coresident antennas, we provide a novel method to avoid the frequencies where the coupling is large enough to prevent successful imaging. Through the use of two different nonlinear reconstruction schemes, which are an enhanced version of the distorted born iterative method and the multiplicative regularized contrast source inversion method, we show imaging results from dielectric phantoms in free space. The early inversion results show that with the frequency selection procedure applied, the system is capable of quantitatively reconstructing dielectric objects, and show that the use of the wideband data improves the inversion results over single-frequency data.},

            This paper deals with active time-harmonic infrared thermography applied to the detection of defects inside thin plates. We propose a method to post-process raw thermograms based on the computation of topological derivatives which will produce much sharper images (namely, where contrast is highly enhanced) than the original thermograms. The reconstruction algorithm does not need information about the number of defects, nor the size or position. A collection of numerical experiments illustrates that the algorithm is highly robust against measurement errors in the thermograms, giving a good approximation of the shape, position and number of defects without the need of an iterative process.},

              In this paper, the authors revisit the computation of closed-form expressions of the topological indicator function for a one step imaging algorithm of two- and three-dimensional sound-soft (Dirichlet condition), sound-hard (Neumann condition) and isotropic inclusions (transmission conditions) in the free space.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              From the addition theorem for translated harmonics, explicit expressions of the scattered waves by infinitesimal circular (and spherical) holes subject to an incident plane wave or a compactly supported distribution of point sources are available. Then the authors derive the first-order term in the asymptotic expansion of the Dirichlet and Neumann traces and their surface derivatives on the boundary of the singular medium perturbation.

              The purpose of this paper is to revisit the recursive computation of closed-form expressions for the topological derivative of shape functionals in the context of time-harmonic acoustic waves scattering by sound-soft (Dirichlet condition), sound-hard (Neumann condition) and isotropic inclusions (transmission conditions).

              The elliptic boundary value problems in the singularly perturbed domains are equivalently reduced to couples of boundary integral equations with unknown densities given by boundary traces. In the case of circular or spherical holes, the spectral Fourier and Mie series expansions of the potential operators are used to derive the first-order term in the asymptotic expansion of the boundary traces for the solution to the two- and three-dimensional perturbed problems.

            This paper deals with active time-harmonic infrared thermography applied to the detection of defects inside thin plates. We propose a method to post-process raw thermograms based on the computation of topological derivatives which will produce much sharper images (namely, where contrast is highly enhanced) than the original thermograms. The reconstruction algorithm does not need information about the number of defects, nor the size or position. A collection of numerical experiments illustrates that the algorithm is highly robust against measurement errors in the thermograms, giving a good approximation of the shape, position and number of defects without the need of an iterative process.},

We will process thermograms by a mathematical tool called topological derivative, showing its efficiency in very demanding situations where thermograms are highly polluted by noise, and/or when the parameters of the medium fluctuate randomly.
