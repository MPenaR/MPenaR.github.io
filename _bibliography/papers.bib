            This paper deals with active time-harmonic infrared thermography applied to the detection of defects inside thin plates. We propose a method to post-process raw thermograms based on the computation of topological derivatives which will produce much sharper images (namely, where contrast is highly enhanced) than the original thermograms. The reconstruction algorithm does not need information about the number of defects, nor the size or position. A collection of numerical experiments illustrates that the algorithm is highly robust against measurement errors in the thermograms, giving a good approximation of the shape, position and number of defects without the need of an iterative process.},

	abstract = {A thermogram is a color image produced by a thermal camera where each color level represents a different radiation intensity (temperature). In this paper, we study the use of steady and time-harmonic thermograms for structural health monitoring of thin plates. Since conductive heat transfer is short range and the associated signal–to–noise ratio is not much favorable, efficient data processing tools are required to successfully interpret thermograms. We will process thermograms by a mathematical tool called topological derivative, showing its efficiency in very demanding situations where thermograms are highly polluted by noise, and/or when the parameters of the medium fluctuate randomly. An exhaustive gallery of numerical simulations will be presented to assess the performance and limitations of this tool.},
